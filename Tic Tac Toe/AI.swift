//This is the file where all AI implementation is handled. Initially a start with satisfying all required functions and protocols and each of the variables. Set up Didn't have much time to go further with this part, but there's plenty of potential code. Ran into a hangup when trying to have the AI class conform to NSObject, GKGameModel, GKGameModelPlayer, and GKGameModelUpdate. My thoughts were to then remove the protocols and created extensions. Instead creating classes for the In the future, I'd separate the protocol logic from the AI class and simply implement the computer wins and player goes first logic. Should make the code a bit cleaner and concise.
